# Code Review 1 - Comments - Harman Sidhu
Great job with organizing different files and intuitive comments on each section of the code. I really enjoyed looking at the code and how beautifully it is written.
I am not sure if we are supposed to have a separate folder for each project submission as you have here as Project 1, I think it will be better to lose that folder as this is an iterative submission in the form of different project (Do consult the TA or the Professor regarding this to be sure).

Very well written README.md file as well under the folder "project1"
